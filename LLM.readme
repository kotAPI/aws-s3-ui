# S3 Bucket Management UI

A modern, intuitive interface for managing and using Amazon S3 buckets.

## Project Overview

This application provides a comprehensive UI for interacting with AWS S3 storage, making bucket and object management accessible to both technical and non-technical users.

## Feature Set

### Core Bucket Management
- **Bucket Dashboard**: Overview of all buckets with key metrics (size, object count, cost)
- **Create/Delete/Configure**: Wizards for creating new buckets with proper configurations
- **Bucket Properties Editor**: Interface for setting versioning, lifecycle rules, CORS, etc.
- **Bucket Search**: Quickly find buckets in large AWS environments

### Object Management
- **File Browser**: Intuitive navigation through bucket directories
- **Drag & Drop Upload**: Modern upload interface with progress indicators
- **Bulk Operations**: Select multiple files for batch actions (delete, move, download)
- **Preview Capabilities**: Preview images, videos, PDFs, and text files without downloading
- **Version Management**: View and restore previous versions of objects

### Access Control
- **Permission Editor**: Visual interface for bucket policies and ACLs
- **User Management**: Interface to assign permissions to IAM users
- **Shareable Links**: Generate time-limited pre-signed URLs for object sharing
- **Access Logs Viewer**: Visualize who accessed what and when

### Advanced Features
- **Storage Class Optimization**: Recommendations for moving infrequently accessed data
- **Cost Analysis**: Visualize storage costs and optimization opportunities
- **Transfer Acceleration**: Enable/configure for faster uploads to distant locations
- **Automated Workflows**: Set up event triggers when objects are added/modified
- **Replication Setup**: UI for configuring cross-region replication
- **Metrics & Monitoring**: Visualize usage patterns and set alerts

### User Experience
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Access from any device
- **Dark/Light Themes**: Support different viewing preferences
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Power user features for quick navigation
- **Customizable Views**: List, grid, or detail views of objects
- **Sync Client**: Optional desktop sync for selected buckets

## Technical Considerations

### Implementation Approach
- **Cross-platform**: Web-based or native apps for different platforms
- **Authentication**: Secure login with MFA support
- **Performance**: Strategies for handling large buckets with thousands of objects
- **Offline Support**: Limited functionality when offline

### Technology Stack Options
- Frontend: React/Vue/Angular
- Backend: Node.js, Python, or serverless functions
- Authentication: AWS Cognito or custom solution
- Storage: LocalStorage/IndexedDB for client-side caching
